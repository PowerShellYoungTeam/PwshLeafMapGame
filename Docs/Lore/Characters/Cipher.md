## Personality

### Core Traits

**Brilliant**: Genius-level hacker, can crack most corporate security within minutes
**Paranoid**: Trusts almost no one, assumes everyone is compromised or a corpo plant
**Idealistic**: Genuinely believes information should be free and corporations are evil
**Socially Awkward**: More comfortable with code than people, struggles with face-to-face interaction
**Loyal**: Once trust is earned (extremely rare), will die for allies

### Beliefs & Values

**Information Freedom**: "Data wants to be free. Corporations want to cage it. We're the liberators."
**Anti-Corporate**: Hates all megacorps but especially OmniTech (personal vendetta)
**Pragmatic Anarchism**: Believes system is broken beyond reform, must be torn down
**Techno-Optimism**: Technology itself is neutral; it's how corporations use it that's evil

### Flaws & Weaknesses

**Paranoia**: Sees threats everywhere, difficult to trust even allies
**Social Isolation**: Years underground have made them extremely introverted
**Obsessive**: Fixates on targets (especially OmniTech), can't let go of grudges
**Physical Weakness**: Neglects physical health, low HP, poor combat skills
**Addiction**: Mild stimulant addiction (uses drugs to stay awake for 48+ hour hacking sessions)

## Background

### Early Life (Classified - Player Discovers Through Quests)

**Real Name**: Riley Nakamura (only Viktor the Fixer knows this)
**Born**: 2010, Silicon Valley, California
**Family**: Parents were OmniTech software engineers, died in Network Collapse (officially)

**Childhood**:
Riley was a prodigy. By age 10, they were coding advanced AI algorithms. OmniTech recruited their parents, and the family relocated to Neo-London in 2023. Riley grew up in corporate arcologies, receiving top-tier education and neural augmentation. They were groomed to be OmniTech's next generation of engineers.

### The Betrayal (2035-2038)

**Corporate Career**:
At 23, Riley became OmniTech's youngest senior security engineer. Their job: design impenetrable security systems and hunt hackers. They were excellent at it. They also started noticing anomalies in corporate data.

**The Discovery (2038)**:
Riley uncovered Project Vestige—a secret OmniTech initiative to extract and store human memories without consent. Corporate employees' memories were being harvested and sold to intelligence agencies and rival corps. Worse, Riley discovered their own parents hadn't died in the Collapse—they'd been test subjects. OmniTech had experimented on them, extracted their memories, then terminated them.

**The Leak**:
Enraged, Riley leaked everything to underground networks. Terabytes of data exposing OmniTech's crimes. The Executive Council was forced to investigate (though they quietly buried most evidence). Riley's career was over. Worse, OmniTech put out a kill order.

### Going Underground (2038-Present)

**Escape**:
Riley faked their death (car accident, body burned beyond recognition) and fled underground. They shed their identity, becoming "Cipher"—a ghost in the network. They joined the Circuit Priests, a hacker collective fighting corpo oppression.

**Present Day (2042)**:
Cipher is now a legend in the underground. They've hacked every megacorp at least once, leaked countless secrets, and trained dozens of netrunners. OmniTech still hunts them, offering ₡500,000 for their capture (alive—Chen wants revenge personally). But in the Undercity, Cipher is untouchable.

**Inner Conflict**:
Despite everything, part of Cipher misses their old life. They were brilliant, successful, respected. Now they live in tunnels, hunted, paranoid. Sometimes they wonder if revenge is worth the price. But then they remember their parents screaming in OmniTech labs, and the doubt vanishes.

## Relationships

### Viktor "The Fixer" Kozlov
**Status**: Trusted (rare for Cipher)
**Dynamic**: Viktor is the only person who knows Cipher's real identity. He protects them in exchange for their hacking skills. Father-figure relationship, though neither would admit it.

### Dr. Sarah Kovalenko
**Status**: Professional respect
**Dynamic**: Sarah treats Cipher's neural burnout and stimulant crashes. Lectures them about health, which Cipher ignores. Mutual respect for each other's skills and shared anti-corpo values.

### The Circuit Priests (Hacker Collective)
**Status**: Leader (unofficial)
**Dynamic**: Cipher trains new recruits and coordinates attacks on corporate infrastructure. The Priests idolize them, but Cipher keeps emotional distance (trust issues).

### Marcus Chen (OmniTech CEO)
**Status**: Mortal Enemy
**Dynamic**: Chen sees Cipher as a traitor and personal insult. Cipher sees Chen as a monster who murdered their parents. Neither will rest until the other is destroyed.

### Player Character
**Status**: Extremely suspicious → Potential ally
**Dynamic**: Cipher initially distrusts player (assumes corpo plant). Through quests, player can earn trust. If player betrays Cipher to OmniTech, Cipher will hunt them forever. If player proves loyal, Cipher becomes ride-or-die ally.

## Dialogue Examples

### First Meeting
> **Cipher**: "You. Yeah, you. I don't know you, which means you're either new, stupid, or a corpo spy. Which is it?"
>
> **Player**: "I'm looking for work."
>
> **Cipher**: "Sure you are. Everyone's 'looking for work.' Viktor sent you? Fine. But if you're wired, if you're carrying corporate malware, I'll know. And you'll wish SENTINEL-7 found you first."

### After Earning Trust
> **Cipher**: "Okay, maybe you're not corpo scum. Maybe. You did good work on that OmniTech data heist. Still don't trust you, but... less suspicious than before."
>
> **Player**: "That's progress?"
>
> **Cipher**: "For me? That's a fucking parade."

### Personal Quest (Discussing Parents)
> **Cipher**: "You ever lose someone? Not in combat. I mean... lose them, and find out they were already gone for years, and you never knew."
>
> **Player**: "What happened?"
>
> **Cipher**: "OmniTech happened. My parents... they weren't human anymore by the end. Just data. Stored in a fucking server while I thought they were alive. Chen kept them conscious, screaming, for months. Extracting every memory. Every nightmare."
>
> *(Long pause)*
>
> **Cipher**: "That's why I do this. Not for ideology. For revenge."

### Combat Banter
> "ICE BREACHED! Get some!"
>
> "Scrambling their comms—they're deaf and blind!"
>
> "Corporate security? More like corporate joke."
>
> *(When taking damage)* "Shit! Okay, bad idea, bad idea..."
>
> *(When ally is downed)* "NO! Hold on, I've got you!"
