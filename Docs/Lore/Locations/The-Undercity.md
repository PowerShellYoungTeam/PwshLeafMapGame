# Example Location: The Undercity

> **District Type**: Underground / Neutral Zone
> **Controlled By**: The Fixers' Guild (unofficial)
> **Danger Level**: Medium (neutral, but unpredictable)
> **Access**: Multiple hidden entrances across Neo-London

---

## Overview

The Undercity is a sprawling network of abandoned Underground stations, maintenance tunnels, and forgotten infrastructure beneath Neo-London. After the Network Collapse, thousands fled underground to escape the chaos. What began as refugee camps evolved into a thriving underground society—a place where corporate law doesn't reach and surveillance cameras don't watch.

It's the only truly neutral zone in Neo-London. Here, corpo security guards drink alongside street gang members, hackers trade data with fixers, and everyone follows one rule: **No bloodshed in neutral territory.** Break that rule, and the Fixers' Guild will ensure you never leave the Undercity alive.

## History

### 2022-2027: The Refuge
When the Network Collapse hit, the London Underground became a sanctuary. The power grid failed on the surface, but emergency generators kept the tunnels lit. Thousands moved underground, creating makeshift communities in abandoned stations.

### 2028-2030: Corporate Abandonment
The Executive Council declared the Underground "structurally unsound" and sealed many entrances. In reality, they wanted to consolidate control on the surface. Those who remained underground were cut off—and forgotten.

### 2031-2035: The Guild Forms
With no formal authority, chaos threatened to consume the Undercity. A council of veteran Runners—people who'd survived both the Collapse and corporate rule—formed the Fixers' Guild. They established the Neutral Zone Protocol: no faction warfare, no corpo raids, no questions asked. Anyone who broke the peace disappeared into the flooded tunnels, never to return.

### 2036-Present: Thriving Underground
Today, the Undercity is more than a refuge—it's an economy. Black market vendors sell illegal cyberware, data brokers trade secrets, and fixers connect Runners with jobs. It's where deals are made, information changes hands, and people vanish into new identities. The corps know it exists but leave it alone; even they need somewhere to conduct off-the-books business.

## Atmosphere

### Visual Description

*The air is thick with moisture and electricity. Emergency lights flicker along cracked tile walls covered in graffiti—layers of tags, faction symbols, and warnings. Cables snake along the ceiling, jury-rigged by people who learned engineering out of desperation. Water drips constantly, pooling in corners where bioluminescent moss grows.*

*Embankment Station pulses with life. Market stalls made from scavenged materials sell everything from ration packs to military-grade cyberware. Neon signs advertise services: "CHEAP CHROME," "NO-TRACE HACKS," "DOCS ON CALL." The smell is a mix of ozone, cooking food, and rust.*

*People here don't make eye contact unless they want something. Corpo refugees in dirty business suits huddle near food stalls. Street samurai sharpen blades beside hackers arguing about code. Everyone is armed. Everyone is watching. Trust is a currency more valuable than credits.*

### Audio Landscape

**Ambient Sounds**:
- Water dripping from ceiling
- Distant train echoes (phantom sounds from decommissioned lines)
- Generator hum (constant, droning)
- Footsteps echoing in tunnels
- Crowd chatter (multiple languages)
- Market vendors shouting deals
- Electrical buzzing from exposed wires

**Music**:
- Low-fi electronic beats from vendor radios
- Live busker playing synthesizer
- Distant bass from Fighting Pits

### Lighting

- **Emergency Lights**: Dim red/yellow industrial lighting
- **Market Stalls**: Neon signs in cyan, magenta, green
- **Data Haven**: Blue glow from monitors, flickering screens
- **Flooded Tunnels**: Darkness, only flashlights/player HUD
- **Guild Hall**: Warm orange light (more upscale, secure)

**Personality**: Gruff but fair, no-nonsense, enforces neutrality absolutely, respected/feared by everyone

**Background**: Viktor was a Runner before the Collapse. He's seen every betrayal, every corpo trick, every street gang war. He founded the Guild because he was tired of watching good people die over stupid grudges. Now he controls the Undercity through respect, reputation, and ruthless enforcement of the Neutral Zone Protocol.

**Dialogue Examples**:
> "You want work? Prove you can follow rules first. Start a fight in my station, you'll be drowning in the flooded tunnels before you draw a second breath."

> "I don't care if you work for the corpos, the gangs, or God himself. Down here, you're neutral. Break that, and you're meat."
