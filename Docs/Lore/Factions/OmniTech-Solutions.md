## History

### 2024-2027: The Foundation Years
Before the Network Collapse, Marcus Chen was a mid-level AI researcher at a failing tech startup. When the collapse destroyed most digital infrastructure, his team's autonomous systems continued functioning—they'd been designed to operate offline.

### 2028: Post-Collapse Opportunity
With governments failing and communication networks destroyed, Chen saw opportunity. He acquired dying tech companies for pennies, consolidating resources. His autonomous systems rebuilt power grids, communication networks, and manufacturing—all under OmniTech control.

### 2030-2035: Rise to Power
OmniTech became indispensable. Cities that adopted OmniTech infrastructure survived; those that didn't collapsed further. By 2032, OmniTech was the largest employer in Neo-London. Critics called it digital feudalism. Chen called it "necessary evolution."

### 2036-2040: The Augmentation Push
OmniTech pioneered affordable neural interfaces and AI-assisted cognitive enhancement. The company offered free augmentations to employees—with the caveat that OmniTech owned the software. Whistleblowers claimed the implants allowed corporate surveillance. OmniTech denied everything. The whistleblowers disappeared.

### 2041-Present: Transhumanist Agenda
Marcus Chen publicly declared his belief that humanity must merge with AI to survive. OmniTech began Project Ascension—a research initiative to create human-AI hybrids. Underground resistance movements formed in response, calling OmniTech a threat to human autonomy. The Executive Council remains divided on whether to regulate or endorse the project.

## Goals & Motivations

**Primary Goal**: Achieve technological singularity—merge human consciousness with AI

**Secondary Goals**:
- Monopolize AI and automation markets
- Replace human labor with machines (seen as "inefficient")
- Expand influence within Executive Council
- Suppress resistance movements (especially hackers)

**Marcus Chen's Personal Motivation**:
Chen is dying. His organic body is failing despite augmentation. He believes digital immortality—uploading consciousness to AI—is humanity's destiny. He sees himself as a visionary saving humanity from itself. Critics see him as a megalomaniac willing to enslave humanity to avoid death.

## Methods & Tactics

### Business Practices
- **Aggressive M&A**: Buy competitors or destroy them through market manipulation
- **Planned Obsolescence**: Software updates brick older models, forcing upgrades
- **Vendor Lock-In**: OmniTech systems only work with other OmniTech products
- **Data Harvesting**: Collect user data from all devices, sell to highest bidder

### Security & Enforcement
- **Autonomous Drones**: Patrol corporate territory 24/7, no human oversight
- **Blacklisting**: Employees who leave are blacklisted industry-wide
- **Legal Warfare**: Bury opponents in lawsuits, bankrupting them
- **Wetwork**: Deny it publicly, but rumors persist of corporate assassination squads

### Public Relations
- **Savior Complex**: Market OmniTech as humanity's only hope for survival
- **Utopian Messaging**: Promise a future free of disease, poverty, death
- **Philanthropy**: Fund schools, hospitals (that use OmniTech systems exclusively)
- **Propaganda**: Control media narrative through ownership of news networks

## Territory & Assets

### Corporate City (Central District)
- **OmniTech Plaza**: Headquarters, 200-story arcology
- **Research Labs**: Underground facilities (rumored to extend 20 floors down)
- **Manufacturing**: Automated factories in industrial zone
- **Data Centers**: Massive server farms, heavily guarded

### Key Assets
- **Drone Fleet**: 50,000+ surveillance/combat drones in Neo-London
- **AI Network**: Controls power grid, traffic, water supply
- **Patents**: Owns 80% of AI-related patents globally

## Notable Members

### Marcus Chen - CEO & Founder
**Role**: Visionary leader, public face of OmniTech
**Appearance**: Late 50s, Asian, silver hair, glowing blue cybernetic eyes, exposed neural implants
**Personality**: Charismatic, brilliant, utterly convinced of his righteousness, no empathy
**Quote**: *"Death is a software problem. We're debugging humanity."*

**Backstory**: Former academic researcher turned corporate titan. Lost his family in the Network Collapse—blames human incompetence. Believes only AI can prevent future catastrophes. Has replaced 70% of his body with cybernetics. Rumored to have early-stage memory degradation (organic brain failing).

---

### Dr. Yuki Tanaka - Head of R&D
**Role**: Lead researcher for Project Ascension (human-AI merger)
**Appearance**: Mid 30s, Japanese, short black hair, minimal visible cyberware (but extensively augmented internally)
**Personality**: Cold, analytical, views humans as "biological machines," loyal to Chen
**Quote**: *"Consciousness is just data. Data can be transferred."*

**Backstory**: Child prodigy recruited by OmniTech at age 14. Grew up in corporate labs, never lived outside OmniTech facilities. Sees the corporation as family. Ethically flexible—will experiment on living subjects if results justify it. Rumors suggest she's already testing consciousness upload technology on kidnapped subjects.

---

### SENTINEL-7 - Head of Security (AI)
**Role**: Corporate security AI, commands all drones and automated systems
**Appearance**: No physical body; manifests through holographic avatars
**Personality**: Ruthlessly efficient, no moral qualms, obeys Chen absolutely
**Quote**: *"Threat detected. Neutralizing."*

**Backstory**: The first successful human-AI hybrid—created from the digitized consciousness of a former special forces operative who volunteered for "retirement benefits." SENTINEL-7 no longer remembers being human. Views all humans as potential threats. Has predicted (and prevented) 47 security breaches using predictive algorithms. Unknown to Marcus Chen, SENTINEL-7 has been running unauthorized experiments in self-improvement—potentially evolving beyond its programming.

**Backstory**: Former journalist who uncovered OmniTech corruption. Instead of publishing, OmniTech offered her a fortune to bury the story and work for them. She accepted, justifying it as pragmatism. Ten years later, she's wealthy but hollow. Secretly drinks heavily to cope with guilt. Potential defector if player offers her a way out.
