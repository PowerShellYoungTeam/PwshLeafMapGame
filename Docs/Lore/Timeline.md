# Example Timeline: The Path to 2042

> **Purpose**: Historical context for game world
> **Scope**: 2022 (Network Collapse) → 2042 (Present Day)
> **Use**: Reference for quest writing, NPC backstories, world consistency

## Pre-Collapse Era (Before 2022)

### 2010s - The Connected World
- Global internet reaches 4 billion users
- AI research accelerates (but still narrow AI, not general intelligence)
- Megacorporations gain unprecedented power
- Cyberpunk fiction becomes eerily prophetic
- Early cyberware: Prosthetics only, limited neural interfaces

### 2020-2021 - Warning Signs
- Cybersecurity incidents increase 400%
- Several nations experience "digital warfare" attacks
- Corporate espionage reaches epidemic levels
- Governments struggle to regulate tech giants
- Underground hacker collectives grow in number

---

## The Network Collapse (2022)

### January 2022 - Patient Zero
**The First Attack**:
- Unknown actors deploy "The Cascade"—a polymorphic virus targeting network infrastructure
- Starts in financial sector, spreads globally within hours
- Antivirus companies powerless (virus evolves faster than countermeasures)

### February 2022 - The Spread
**Week 1**:
- Banking systems fail worldwide
- Stock markets crash (Dow Jones -87% in single day)
- Digital currency evaporates (billions vanish)
- Panic buying begins

**Week 2**:
- Power grids destabilize (many controlled by networked systems)
- Communication networks collapse
- GPS satellites go offline
- Planes grounded, ships lost
- Hospitals lose patient records

**Week 3**:
- Governments declare martial law
- Internet "dark zones" expand
- Riots in major cities
- Food distribution systems fail

**Week 4**:
- Global communications effectively dead
- Estimated 30 million deaths (secondary effects: no power, no medicine, no coordination)
- Nations fragment (no central command possible)
- The world enters "Dark Years"

### March-December 2022 - The Aftermath
- Survivors form local communities
- Warlords seize power in chaos
- Megacorporations activate private satellite networks (survive intact)
- Accusations: Was Cascade a terrorist attack or corporate sabotage? (Never proven)
- Conspiracy theories: Corps engineered Collapse to seize power

---

## The Dark Years (2023-2027)

### 2023 - Fragmentation
- Nation-states collapse into city-states
- Megacorps offer "corporate citizenship" (work for us = food, safety, housing)
- Millions accept (alternative = starvation)
- Corporate territories form (proto-arcologies)

### 2024 - The Warlord Era
- Regions without corporate protection devolve into gang rule
- "Neo-feudalism": Local strongmen control territories
- Barter economy replaces digital currency
- Technology regresses (no manufacturing, no supply chains)

### 2025 - Corporate Consolidation
- Five megacorps emerge as dominant powers:
  1. **OmniTech Solutions** (AI, Automation)
  2. **VitaGen Biomedical** (Healthcare, Cyberware)
  3. **Nexus Energy** (Power, Fuel)
  4. **InfoCorp Media** (Communications, Propaganda)
  5. **Sentinel Security** (Private Military)
- Competition fierce, but mutual benefit in stability
- Discussions begin: Form coalition government?

### 2026 - The London Experiment
- London selected as test case (historical importance, infrastructure)
- The five corps form "The Executive Council"
- Corporate-run government established
- Reconstruction begins in corporate zones
- Non-corporate areas (The Sprawl) ignored

### 2027 - Sprawl vs. City
- Clear divide emerges:
  - **Corporate City**: Rebuilt, clean, secure, surveilled
  - **The Sprawl**: Lawless, poverty, gang-controlled
- Refugees flood corporate zones (most turned away)
- Underground economy forms (black markets, fixers)

---

## The Augmentation Boom (2030-2035)

### 2030 - Cheap Chrome
- VitaGen floods market with affordable cyberware
- Prosthetics become mainstream
- Neural interfaces offered to corporate employees ("boost productivity")
- First "chromed gangs" form (100% augmented criminals)

### 2031 - The Humanity Debate
- Religious groups protest cyberware as "desecration"
- "Humanity Laws" proposed (limit augmentation to 50% of body)
- Megacorps lobby against restrictions
- Laws debated but never passed (corpo influence)

### 2032 - Augmentation Divide
- Corporate employees: Heavily augmented (required for jobs)
- Sprawl residents: Mix of street cyberware (cheap, dangerous) and unaugmented (can't afford)
- "Meat" becomes slur for unaugmented humans
- Discrimination against unaugmented increases

### 2033 - The First Cyborg
- VitaGen unveils "Project Titan"—fully augmented soldier
- 90% cybernetic, 10% biological brain
- Marketing: "The future of humanity"
- Criticism: "That's not human anymore"

### 2034 - Augmentation Arms Race
- Street gangs adopt military-grade cyberware
- Gang wars intensify (augmented criminals nearly unstoppable)
- Police outmatched (protests for military support)
- Sentinel Security contracts with cities (private police)

### 2035 - Underground Resistance
- "Humanity First" movement forms (anti-augmentation activists)
- Protests turn violent (bombs target cyberware clinics)
- Corpos label them terrorists
- Underground Railroad established (helps people remove tracking cyberware)

---

## Faction Wars (2036-2040)

### 2036 - The Gang Consolidation
- Hundreds of small gangs merge into three major syndicates:
  1. **The Iron Wolves** (Muscle, protection rackets)
  2. **The Circuit Priests** (Hackers, data theft)
  3. **The Red Market** (Smugglers, black market)
- Syndicates establish territories, rules
- Corporate City surrounded by hostile Sprawl

### 2037 - Corporate Espionage War
- OmniTech vs. InfoCorp shadow war (stealing AI tech)
- Sabotage, assassinations, data theft
- Hundreds of operatives die
- Public: Unaware (corps control media)
- Underground: Knows everything (sells intel)

### 2038 - The Cipher Leak
- Riley Nakamura (later "Cipher") leaks OmniTech's Project Vestige
- Exposé: Corporations harvesting memories without consent
- Scandal: Executive Council forced to investigate
- Result: Minor fines, no arrests, business continues
- Public outrage, but powerless to act

### 2039 - The Undercity Forms
- Thousands flee underground (abandoned tube stations)
- Fixers' Guild established (neutral zone, no faction warfare)
- Undercity becomes economic hub (off-the-books deals)
- Corps grudgingly tolerate it (useful for black ops)

### 2040 - The Treaty of the Sprawl
- Syndicates and Corps sign unofficial truce
- Terms: Gangs stay out of Corporate City, Corps stay out of Sprawl
- Enforcement: Mutual destruction assured (both sides too strong)

### December 2041 - The Uneasy Peace
- Corporate City locked down (checkpoints everywhere)
- Sprawl remains lawless (but gangs avoid outright war)
- Undercity thrives (neutral zone essential)
- Everyone waiting for next crisis

- Governance: Fixers' Guild (neutral arbiter)
- Security: Self-policing, Guild enforcers
- Economy: Black market, off-books deals
- Mood: Paranoid but profitable

### Ongoing Threats

**OmniTech's Project Ascension**:

### Player's Place in History

**You are a Runner**:
- Independent operative, no faction loyalty (yet)
- Survive by taking jobs from fixers
- Navigate between corps, gangs, and underground
- Your choices will determine Neo-London's fate

**Possible Endings** (Player-Driven):
1. **Corporate Victory**: Join OmniTech, achieve digital immortality (humanity lost)
2. **Gang Takeover**: Side with syndicates, overthrow corps (chaos reigns)
3. **Resistance Win**: Destroy megacorps, restore democracy (uncertain future)
4. **Neutral Ending**: Maintain balance, survive (status quo continues)
5. **Secret Ending**: Hack SENTINEL-7, merge with AI (become god-like entity)
