## World Overview

### The Year: [Your Year, e.g., 2042]

**[Write a 2-3 paragraph overview of your world's current state]**

**Example**:
> *The year is 2042, twenty years after the "Network Collapse" - a catastrophic cyberattack that destroyed 80% of global communications infrastructure. In the chaos that followed, national governments fractured. Megacorporations, with their private military forces and intact satellite networks, became the de facto authorities.*
>
> *Neo-London emerged from the ashes as a corporate protectorate, governed by the Executive Council - a coalition of the five most powerful corporations. The city is divided into zones: gleaming corporate arcologies where employees live their entire lives, and the Sprawl, where everyone else fights for scraps.*
>
> *You are a "Runner" - an independent operative who takes jobs no one else will. In a world where loyalty is bought and sold, information is currency, and augmenting your body with machines is the only way to compete, survival means staying one step ahead of everyone trying to use you.*

### The Setting: [Your City Name]

**Why This Location?**
**[Explain your choice of setting]**

**Example**:
- **Real-World Base**: London, England
- **Renamed**: Neo-London (after corporate reconstruction)
- **Why London?**:
  - Rich historical architecture mixed with modern buildings (visual contrast)
  - Thames River creates natural district boundaries
  - Underground tunnel system (The Undercity gameplay area)
  - Existing OpenStreetMap data for realistic navigation
  - Cultural melting pot (diverse NPC populations)
  - Foggy/rainy weather fits noir cyberpunk atmosphere

**City Population**: [Define scale]
- Example: *~12 million registered citizens, estimated 4 million "ghosts" (unregistered)*

**City Size**: [Define playable area]
- Example: *Central 50 square kilometers (from Westminster to Canary Wharf)*

**What's NOT Possible?**
**[Set limits to maintain balance]**

### Daily Life Scenarios

**[Write short scenes showing what life is like]**

**Example - Corporate Employee**:
> *Sarah-7743 wakes to her neural alarm at precisely 06:00. The apartment lights adjust automatically as she dresses in her OmniTech uniform. Breakfast is a nutrient bar - 87% of her daily requirements. She scans her RFID badge at the door, and the building AI logs her departure. The monorail is on time. It's always on time. At her desk by 07:30, neural interface connecting her to the company network. Eight hours of optimizing algorithms. Lunch is another bar. The AI suggests she's 3% below productivity targets. She stays an extra hour. Home by 19:00. Meal ration delivered by drone. Entertainment: approved corporate streaming. Sleep by 22:00. Tomorrow will be identical.*

**Example - Sprawl Resident**:
> *Kaz doesn't know what time it is - his cheap optical implant flickers. The room is cold; power's out again. He pulls on his armored jacket (street market knockoff, but it's saved his life twice). Breakfast is whatever's left in the communal kitchen - today, nothing. He'll work hungry. Down in the market, he finds his fixer. Three jobs available: bodyguard work for a smuggler (dangerous, pays well), deliver a package (quick, suspicious), or sell some stolen tech (risky, but he needs to eat). He takes all three. By nightfall, he's been shot at twice, made enough for a week's rent, and has a new enemy. Tomorrow he'll need to lay low. Or maybe take revenge. He hasn't decided.*

## Narrative Themes

### Core Themes

**[Define what your story explores]**

**Example Themes**:

#### **1. Identity & Humanity**
- *At what point does augmentation make you no longer human?*
- *Is your mind still yours if corporations can hack it?*
- Character arcs explore: Runners losing themselves to chrome, NPCs questioning their cybernetic existence

#### **2. Freedom vs Security**
- *Would you trade freedom for safety?*
- *Corporate citizens are safe but enslaved; Sprawl residents are free but endangered*
- Player choices: Work for corps (stable, restrictive) vs underground (chaotic, free)

#### **3. Power & Corruption**
- *What would you do with unlimited power?*
- *Every faction claims noble goals but uses brutal methods*
- Moral ambiguity: No "good guys," only shades of gray

#### **4. Loyalty & Betrayal**
- *Who can you trust when everyone has a price?*
- *Your crew members have their own agendas*
- Mechanics: Loyalty system, squad members may betray you if relationship is poor

#### **5. Survival**
- *In a world that wants you dead, how far will you go to live?*
- *Every mission could be your last*
- Tone: Dark, gritty, high-stakes

### Narrative Voice

**[Define how your story is told]**

**Example**:
- **POV**: Second-person ("You wake up in the rain...")
- **Tone**: Cynical but not hopeless, dark humor
- **Prose Style**: Short, punchy sentences for action; longer, descriptive for atmosphere
- **Dialogue**: Natural, uses slang, varies by faction (corpo-speak vs street slang)

**Example Narrative Snippet**:
> *You don't remember how you got here. That's not unusual—memory slots are the first thing ripperdocs check after a botched job. The rain tastes like copper and burnt plastic. Your HUD flickers—three missed calls from Viktor, two from unknown numbers. Both bad signs.*
>
> *The alley ends at a chain-link fence. Beyond it, the glow of Corporate City lights up the smog like a second sunset. Somewhere up there, in a glass tower, someone decided you needed to die. You're not going to make it easy for them.*
>
> *Your pistol has four rounds left. Your cyberarm is at 60% power. You have no backup. You have no plan.*
>
> *But you're still breathing. That's a start.*
